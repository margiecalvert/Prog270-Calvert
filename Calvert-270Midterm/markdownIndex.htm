<p>Sukhothai has traditionally been considered to be the first Thai (Siamese) capital. It was founded in 1239 and remained the capital for 140 years. It was a center of Theravadan Buddhism. Today it is a Unesco World Heritage site. Over 190 temples have been excavated, and some have been partially restored. </p>
<p>Ayutthaya was the second Siamese capital. It was a very large city, with perhaps 300,000 inhabitants in 1600 CE and 1,000,000 in 1700 CE, which would have made it one of the largest cities of its age. The Burmese army sacked the city in 1767, and now only ruins remain. It is also a Unesco World Heritage Site.</p>

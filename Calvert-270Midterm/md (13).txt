Sukhothai cannot be reached directly by train from Bangkok. Instead, a visitor must take the train headed toward Chiang Mai and get off at Phitsanulok. In Phitsanulok, a tuk tuk will take you to the bus station, and from there it is an hour's ride to Sukhothai. Buses run frequently from 7 am to 7 pm. Many visitors say that Sukhothai is an even better place to visit than Ayutthaya. There are fewer tourists in Sukhothai.

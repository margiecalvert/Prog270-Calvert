<p>These are some pictures I really like. The picture just below is Perast, Montenegro, which looks like a very beautiful place. I also included another Montenegro picture on this page. Henderson Canyon is located in Utah, and looks like a great place to visit. St Moritz is in the Swiss Alps. I really love the mountains, wherever they are.</p>
